There are several popular architecture patterns for Android development, including:

Model-View-Controller (MVC)
Model-View-Presenter (MVP)
Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)
Clean Architecture
Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
Reactive Architecture
Each of these patterns has its own pros and cons, and the best choice depends on the specific project and team preferences.

This roadmap will give you a solid foundation in full stack native Android app development. Remember, practice makes perfect, so keep practicing and building apps to improve your skills. Good luck!</string>
